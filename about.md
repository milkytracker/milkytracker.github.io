MilkyTracker is an open source, multi-platform music application for creating [.MOD][mod-file-format] and [.XM][xm-file-format] [module files](module-files). It attempts to recreate the module replay and user experience of the popular DOS program [Fasttracker II][fast-tracker], with special playback modes available for improved Amiga [ProTracker][what-is-protracker] 2/3 compatibility.

#### MilkyTracker's key features:
  * Fasttracker II like, custom graphical user interface with context menus
  * Supported on multiple platforms including portable devices
  * Very accurate .XM replay compared to FT2
  * ProTracker 2/3 playback modes for playing and editing .MOD files
  * Various resampler options including emulated Amiga 500/1200 sound output
  * Choose between a modern and a true-to-FT2 editing scheme / keyboard layout
  * Tabbed user interface for opening and playing up to 32 modules simultaneously and for exchanging data between them
  * Over 30 imported module formats
  * Basic archive support for loading zipped, powerpacked and UMX modules directly
  * Rendering songs/patterns to disk (.WAV) or directly to sample
  * Powerful sample editor featuring waveform generators
  * In-depth instrument editor featuring envelope zooming and scaling and support for copying and swapping instruments and samples across tabs
  * Low latency audio driver support
  * MIDI In support
  * Module optimizer
  * Internal file browser option
  * Various font sizes for improved visibility of pattern data
  * Prospective pattern view option
  * Playing and editing simultaneously
  * Live mode for seamless pattern changes

#### A couple of facts:
  * MilkyTracker is not based on any common module replay. Its core MilkyPlay has been in development since the mid-90s, originally as a Digitrakker .MDL player.
  * MilkyTracker development started a decade later for the [Pocket PC][pocket-pc] and it still fully operates on rather humble PDAs.
  * MilkyTracker is and will stay a 2nd generation tracker. There are already several good 3rd generation trackers out there.
