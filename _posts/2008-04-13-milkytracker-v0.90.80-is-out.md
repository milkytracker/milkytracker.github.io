This is a big release for us and we hope you'll like it too. As usual, the new
version fixes several bugs and replay issues but more interestingly, the code
refactoring has resulted in two things: A) Cool new features. B) MilkyTracker is
now open source ([GPL][gpl]). That's right, dig in, patch, port, maintain, you are
welcome to do so. Linux distributions can also now include MilkyTracker in their
sofware repositories, so spread the word. We'd also like to see some quality
player plugins and whatnot come out of this.

You might have already noticed but with the new release, the website was also
rebooted and the [manual](docs/manual/MilkyTracker.html) now has a comprehensive list
of the [effect commands](docs/manual/MilkyTracker.html#effects) with their
explanations. Hoping to serve you better and all in all, provide a better
MilkyTracker experience. If you're still reading this, now would be a good time
to stop and go get your copy of MilkyTracker from [downloads][downloads]. For
more reading, check out the [ChangeLog]({% link docs/ChangeLog.md %}).

~~PS The AmigaOS port will be up in a few days.~~
