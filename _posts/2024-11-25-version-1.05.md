Today (just in time before Xmas), we're releasing a new version of milkytracker: <b>version 1.05</b>.
<br><br>
This release is a big one, and will be good news for serious jungle-music producers (and producers with DAW-fatique in general).<br>
Not only did milkytracker receive a cleaner interface..<br>
But for the first time, milkytracker now ships with a builtin [beta] synthesizer (MilkySynth):

Milkysynth lives in the sample-editor, and features 2 synth-algos: FM (above) and CYCLE (below) for single/multi-cycle waveforms:

There's even a random button (*) to get started with some presets.<br>
This allows (new) users to directly create [seamless looping] samples from scratch.<br>
This reduces the historical 'hunt for samples' [although that's also a beautiful lifestyle/art on itself].

> NOTE: the classic UI can be enabled in <b>config</b> &gt; <b>layout<b> &gt; <b>classic UI</b>

Next to that, the sample-editor now has a flanger/delay:

A deadsimple good sounding reverb:

A 90s [akai-ish] timestretch  ("jjjjuuuunnnngggleeeee").<br>

A 90s gritty filter (can be driven into grit mode):

A sample saturator:

The milky exciter (protracker-like boost using reverbnoise):

And last but not least a <b>vocoder</b> (copy sample to clipboard, then select another sample and rightclick: FX &gt; > Vocode)

<hr>

Realtime audition of many effects (while playing the pattern or note) is now possible too, making it easier to finetune 'the mix' of samples.
<br>
See the documentation (CTRL+H in milkytracker) for more, and check the [ChangeLog](https://github.com/milkytracker/MilkyTracker/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) for an overview.

Happy tracking!<br>
