Today (just in time before Xmas), we're releasing a new version of milkytracker: <b>version 1.05</b> ♥
<br><br>
This release [The MilkySynth edition] is a big one.<br>
It'll be good news for serious jungle-music producers (and producers with DAW-fatique in general).<br>
Not only did milkytracker receive a cleaner interface..<br>
But for the first time, milkytracker now ships with a builtin [beta] synthesizer (<b>MilkySynth</b>):

<br>

<b>MilkySynth</b> lives in the sample-editor, and features 2 synth-algos: FM (above) and CYCLE (below) for single/multi-cycle waveforms:

<br>

There's even a random button (*) to get started with some presets.<br>
This allows (new) users to <b>directly create</b> [seamless looping] samples from scratch.<br>
This reduces the historical 'hunt for samples' [although that's also a beautiful lifestyle/art on itself ♥].

<br>

Various features have moved to the pattern editor (right-click) context menu:

Next to that, the sample-editor now has a <b>flanger/delay</b>:

<br>

A deadsimple good sounding <b>reverb</b>:

<br>

A 90s [akai-ish] <b>timestretch</b>  ("jjjjuuuunnnngggleeeee").<br>

A 90s <b>gritty filter</b> (can be driven into grit mode):

<br>

A sample <b>saturator</b>:

<br>

The milky <b>exciter</b> (protracker-like boost using reverbnoise):

<br>

And last but not least a <b>vocoder</b> (copy sample to clipboard, then select another sample and rightclick: FX &gt; Vocoder)

<hr>

<br>

Realtime audition of many effects (while playing the pattern or note) is now possible too, making it easier to finetune 'the mix' of samples.
<br>
See the documentation (CTRL+H in milkytracker) for more, and check the [ChangeLog](https://github.com/milkytracker/MilkyTracker/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) for an overview.

Happy tracking!<br>
