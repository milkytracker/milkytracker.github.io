Someday we need to bridge all this [probably with Matrix]:

### Matrix chat
<div class="section">
Here's the [matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#milkytracker:matrix.org) for the #milkytracker channel
</div>

### Discord chat
<div class="section">
Here's the [discord invite](https://discord.gg/YhT7SXKBh7) for the #milkytracker channel
</div>

### IRC
<div class="section">
{: style="float: right;"}
![#MilkyTracker Chatroom]({% link img/ircy.png %})

Join us live on the community IRC channel. If you already have an [IRC client program][irc-clients], just join #MilkyTracker on [EsperNet] ([irc.esper.net]).
</div>

<!-- 
We don't need this, do we?
### E-mail
<div class="section">
You can also contact the MilkyTracker team by email at <span class="email">ten.rekcartyklim@troppus</span>. If the address looks weird, maybe you should look at it from <cite>reverse</cite> angle.
</div>

### Forum

<div class="section">
[![MilkyTracker Forum]({% link img/forumpeek.png %})][forum]
Feel lost and need help?  
Found a bug and want to report it?  
Is there a feature you would like to see in MilkyTracker?  
Want to show off your modules or just say "hi" to the people making the tracker?

You can do all that and more if you just head on down to <a href="http://modarchive.org/forums/index.php?board=30.0">our forum</a> and express yourself.
